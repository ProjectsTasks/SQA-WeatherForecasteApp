The flowgraph for the weather forecasting app can be represented as follows:
1.	Start
2.	Check attempts > 0 && !isLoggedIn
3.	Prompt for username
4.	Prompt for password
5.	Loop through login
6.	if (login.username == username):
o	True: Check switch (password == login.password)
	Case true: Print "Login successful!", set isLoggedIn = true, End
	Case false: Print "Invalid password", decrement attempts, go to Step 2
o	False: Continue loop
7.	if (!userFound):
o	True: Print "User not found", decrement attempts, go to Step 2
8.	if (attempts == 0):
o	True: Print "No more attempts left", End
o	False: Go to Step 2
